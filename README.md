# ez-youtube-downloader
This is an application that downloads video or just audios from a youtube link inserted by the user. This hasn't been made for commercial use, it is made only for educational purposes.

## How I've made it

Since the beginning of the project, I've decided to develop a desktop application. For the GUI I've decided to use the Custom Tkinter framework to make things easy. I've also used PyTube to download the videos from youtube and get other information necessary for my project. 

The project is built using python as its main language, so when I had to transform it all into an .exe file, I've chosen pyinstaller to create the executable file as necessary.

## Items to improve

There are several functionalities that I'd like to add to this app, including:

- The possibility to download higher quality videos
- Selecting specific part of video and/or audio
